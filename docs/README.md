# Raspberry Pi Image Builder

**PublicLab.Org**

![](publiclab.svg)

This documentation covers the usage of the builder script for operating system images designed to be included with Public Lab Camera Kits.

Any person may use this script and the related infrastructure for building customized operating systems for their own projects.

It is important to highlight that this project was forked from the [Hypriot project](https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi). Thanks!

## Rationale

Often DIY projects require customizing software. It is an effort to publish these customizations.

This repository could serve to share customizations and develop them *socially*, by means of issuing pull requests and sharing build recipes and resulting images.

This guide serves the purpose of detailing the build process and suggesting a customization workflow.

## Developing

Issuing a PR will build the image. We will merge PRs aligned and suitable to be included in Public Lab's Camera Kits, at the discretion of the maitainers. You are encouraged to fork your own repository and experiment with preparing your own images!

- Repository (GitLab): https://gitlab.com/publiclab/image-builder-rpi

By using Gitlab's automated continuous integration to build images you'll have fresh images built for you every time you push your changes.

For the community's convenience, this repository is also mirrored at Github
